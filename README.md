# Project Name: [Dashboard Clone](https://emmanuel-ogunmola-lendsqr-fe-test.vercel.app/)

## Description:
This project is a clone of the Lendsqr Admin Console, designed to showcase proficiency in frontend development. It includes four main pages: Login, Dashboard, User Page, and User Details Page. The design and functionality closely resemble the original Lendsqr Admin Console, providing a seamless user experience.

## Pages:
1. **Login Page:** Allows users to authenticate themselves into the system.
2. **Dashboard:** Provides an overview of key metrics and data relevant to the admin console.
3. **User Page:** Displays a list of users pulled from a mock API with 500 records.
4. **User Details Page:** Displays detailed information about a specific user, utilizing local storage to store and retrieve user details.
   
## Technologies Used:
- **Next.js:** This React framework was chosen for its server-side rendering (SSR) capabilities. SSR improves initial page load performance and SEO by providing pre-rendered HTML to the browser. Additionally, Next.js offers a well-defined file-based routing system and features for data fetching, making it a great choice for building scalable single-page applications (SPAs).
- **SCSS Modules:** SCSS Modules were utilized for styling, offering modularization and encapsulation of styles, which enhances maintainability and reduces the risk of style conflicts.
- **React Tanstack Tables:** This library provides a powerful and flexible component for building complex tables in React applications. It offers features like sorting, filtering, pagination, and customization options, making it a valuable tool for displaying large datasets.
- **Mocky.io:** This platform provides a free and easy-to-use solution for creating mock APIs. It was used in this project to simulate an API endpoint with 500 user records.
- **Local Storage:** This web storage API allows the application to store user details persistently on the client-side, enabling features like remembering user preferences.
- **Vercel:** This platform offers a streamlined deployment process for static and serverless applications. It was used to deploy the completed application for easy access and sharing.

## Setup Instructions:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/OGEmanuel/lendsqr-fe-test.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd lendsqr-fe-test`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
5. Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`

- The project is mobile responsive, ensuring optimal user experience across different devices.



<!-- This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
